FusionInventory Library Server provides a modular and efficient solution to complete GLPI
or other third-party applications. 
The library process data from both OCS agents and Fusion agents.
Users can easily retrieve data from these agents with the built-in hook system.
Right now it provides an up-to-date inventory.
Later, there will be other actions such as netdiscovery, snmpquery and wakeonlan.

WIKI:
see http://forge.fusioninventory.org/projects/fusioninventory-server-phplib/wiki

INSTALL:
The library comes with 3 folders:
"Classes/"
"data/"
"user/"

You need to give write permission to the apache process on the following folders :
"/path/to/libfusinv-server/data/"
"/path/to/libfusinv-server/user/"

Populate the IDs database
/path/to/FusionLib/Classes/Storage/Inventory/SourceDataFilter/FilesToTreeFolder.php

Test your installation (see TESTS)

CONFIGURATION:
see in "/path/to/libfusinv-server/user/configs.ini" file.

HOOKS (for inventory action):
Create your own hooks according to your needs in "/path/to/libfusinv-server/user/applications/<MyApplication>/FusInvHooks.class.php"
The structure of hooks is available in website sample in "/path/to/libfusinv-server/user/applications/MyWebSite/FusInvHooks.class.php"

That's it ! Your good to go.

ABOUT:
The "Classes/" folder holds all the core components of FusionInventory Library Server.
The "data/" folder is used to store the following informations :
- informations about machine (used by the inventory action)
- log file
- DataFilters, to filter some data from agents in order to provide more valuable information. 
The "user/" folder holds all user-configurable files (config.ini, his application)

TESTS:
To test the library:
-  execute library on CLI with the path of the file from "path/to/libfusinv-server/" to retrieve datas (you can specify an archive (zip only) for more files)
    "php path/to/libfusinv-server/user/main.php path/to/file/file.ocs"
    OR "php path/to/libfusinv-server/user/main.php path/to/file/lotOfFiles.zip"
- Otherwise, specify URI Server to the agent:
    "./fusioninventory-agent --server path/to/libfusinv-server/user/main.php"

You can check the logs in "data/logs/fusioninventory.log".
You can retrieve all information about the machine on an sample website: "/path/to/libfusinv-server/user/applications/MyWebSite".
